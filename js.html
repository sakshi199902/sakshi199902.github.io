<h1> JAVA SCRIPT(JS)</h1>
<h2>A script is a small piece of program that can add interactivity to your website. For example, a script could generate
a pop-up alert box message, or provide a dropdown menu. This script could be written using JavaScript or VBScript.
You can write various small functions, called event handlers using any of the scripting language and then you can trigger
those functions using HTML attributes.</h2>

<h2>Now-a-days, only JavaScript and associated frameworks are being used by most of the web developers, VBScript is not even
supported by various major browsers.You can keep JavaScript code in a separate file and then include it wherever it's 
needed, or you can define functionality inside HTML document itself.</h2>

<h1>External JavaScript</h1>
<h2>If you are going to define a functionality which will be used in various HTML documents then it's better to keep
 that functionality in a separate JavaScript file and then include that file in your HTML documents. A JavaScript file
 will have extension as .js and it will be included in HTML files using "script" tag.</h2>
<h1>A high-level definition</h1>
<h2>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time
 a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content 
updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably
 involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered 
in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</h2>
