<h1> HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</h1>
<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or 
from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included 
cues for the appearance of the document.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
 With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded 
into the rendered page.</h2>
<h2> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting 
structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may
include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to 
interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language 
such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS
 defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer 
of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit 
presentational HTML since 1997.</h2>
<h2>
The task performed by browsers is vital in this scheme, as they are responsible for the 
processing and transformation of the elements into a rendered document. In this regard, 
authors should consider that some elements don't have a tangible represetation: their
 purpose is to provide semantic meaning to the piece of the document they affect. Sometimes,
the information provided by these semantic elements, is used by different types of user-
agents (browsers, search engines, documents processors, etc) to extract additional data
about the document and its parts.
An HTML element is usually composed by two tags: the opening tag and the closing tag.
 An opening tag consists of the element's name encolsed by the lesser-than "<" and
 greater-than ">" signs. The closing tag is constructed like the opening tag but, 
in this case, the element's name is preceded by a slash ("/"). In the following example, 
you'll see the opening and closing tags for the b element.</h2>
