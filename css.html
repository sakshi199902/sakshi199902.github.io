<h1> CASCADING STYLE SHEET</h1>
<h2>CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the preferred way for setting the look and feel of a website.
The style sheets define the colour, size and position of text and other HTML tags, while the HTML files define
the content and how it is organised.Separating them allows you to change the colour scheme without having to
rewrite your entire web site.The cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all
children elements within the parent. For example, setting the colour of body text will mean all headings and paragraphs 
within the body will also be the same colour.Specifying and Using Styles<h2>
<h1>There are three main ways of including a style sheet for a web page or site:</h1>
<h2>Setting the style="?" attribute of a tag, called inline styles
Using the "style" tag within the HTML header tag
Creating and linking to an external CSS file
Basic style sheets usually modify the appearance of html tags such as <body>. When using CSS files or 
style sheets within the header, we can also define classes of styles and apply them to any element using the class="?" 
attribute, but this is beyond the scope of this simple guide.

<h1>The Difference Between Inline, External and Internal CSS Styles</h1>
<h1>There are three ways you can use to implement CSS: internal, external, and inline styles
. Let’s break them down.</h1>

<h1>Internal CSS</h1>
<h2>Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add "style" tag in the "head" section of your HTML 
document.This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However, using 
this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put CSS rules to every page
 of your website.</h2>

<h1>Here’s how you can use internal CSS:</h1>

<h2>Open your HTML page and locate 
"<head>" opening tag.
Put the following code right after the "<head>" tag</h2>
<h1>Advantages of Internal CSS:</h1>
<h2>You can use class and ID selectors in this style sheet. </h2>
<h1>Disadvantages of Internal CSS:</h1>
<h2>Adding the code to the HTML document can increase the page’s size and loading time.</h2>
<h1>External CSS</h1>
<h2>With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be 
created by any text editor in your device (e.g., Notepad++).
This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By 
editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.</h2>
<h1>Advantages of External CSS:</h1>
<h2>Since the CSS code is in a separate document, your HTML files will have a cleaner
 structure 
and are smaller in size.</h2>
<h2>You can use the same css file for multiple pages.</h2>
<h1>Disadvantages of External CSS:</h1>
<h2>Your pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded.</h2>
<h2>Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your site’s download time.</h2>
<h1>Inline CSS</h1>
<h2>Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only 
need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.
This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually.
Managing your website may become too hard if you only use inline CSS.
However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where
you don’t have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only.</h2>
<h1>Advantages of Inline CSS:</h1>
<h2>You can easily and quickly insert CSS rules to an HTML page. That’s why this method is 
useful for testing or previewing the changes, and performing quick-fixes to your website.
</h2>
<h2>You don’t need to create and upload a separate document as in the external style.</h2>
<h1>Disadvantages of Inline CSS:</h1>
<h2>Adding CSS rules to every HTML element is time-consuming and makes your HTML structure 
messy.</h2>
<h2>Styling multiple elements can affect your page’s size and download time.</h2>
